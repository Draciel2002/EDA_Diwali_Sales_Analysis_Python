# EDA_Diwali_Sales_Analysis_Python
"The aim of this project was to analyze Diwali sales data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. These insights help businesses make better decisions for future festive campaigns. Imagine you have all the receipts from a Diwali shopping festival. Using tools like NumPy and Pandas, I calculated key numbers like total revenue and average spending. Then, I used graphs from Matplotlib and Seaborn to show which products sold the most and who the main buyers were. This helped the business understand its customers and improve its future campaigns."
